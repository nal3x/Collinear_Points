#### [Coursera's Algorithms Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) by Princeton University

Week 3 programming assignment: a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of point. FastCollinearPoints achieves n^2logn running time vs n^4 brute-force approach thanks to the use of **mergesort**, an optimal with respect to the number of compares sorting algorithm. Implementations of Java's Comparable and Comparator interfaces.
